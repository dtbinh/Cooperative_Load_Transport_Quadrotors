# Project: Cooperative Load Transport with group of Quadrotors
Overview
---
We address the problem of cooperative transportation of a cable-suspended payload by multiple quadrotors. This work based on the work which is maded by Kumar and Sreenath [1]. In the beginning, we determine the equations describing the dynamics of the system. Then we define the differentiall flatness of a dynamic system and determine the input vector of our system.
