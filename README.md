Overview
---
We address the problem of cooperative transportation of a cable-suspended payload by multiple quadrotors. This work based on the work which is maded by Kumar and Sreenath [1](http://www.kumarrobotics.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/p11.pdf). In the beginning, we determine the equations describing the dynamics of the system. Then we define the differentiall flatness of a dynamic system and determine the flat output vector of our system.  Finally we write a program with matlab to implement the motion of N quadrotors with a mass point.

The equation of motion and the definition of differential flatness are in the note book [2](https://github.com/kaya2016/Cooperative_Load_Transport_Quadrotors/blob/master/Cooperative_Load_Transport_with_group_of_Quadrotors.ipynb)

Dependencies
---
This program requrirs no additional toolboxes


Functions
---
`Quadpolt`: creates an object to plot one of the quadrotor    
`Loadpolt`: create an object to plot the Load    
`DiffFlat`: determines the input vector and the state vector from the output vector  
`CreatTraj`: creates optimal trajectory between two given way points  
`PlotResults`: plots the results.

To start the program with the default value you can use the code:
```matlab
step1
```
